# IoT-Based Smart Bin - A Swachh Bharat Initiative

## Project Overview
The IoT-Based Smart Bin project is designed to enhance waste management by implementing smart bins that use IoT technology to monitor and manage waste levels. This initiative aligns with the Swachh Bharat Mission by promoting cleanliness and efficient waste management.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of waste levels
- Automated alerts for waste collection
- Data analytics for waste management
- Integration with mobile and web applications for user notifications

## Technologies Used
- Microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, temperature sensors)
- IoT Platforms (e.g., AWS IoT, Azure IoT)
- Mobile and Web Applications (e.g., React, Node.js)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Assemble the smart bin with sensors and microcontrollers as per the hardware design.

2. **Software Setup:**
   - Clone this repository.
   - Set up the IoT platform and configure sensors.
   - Install required software libraries and tools.

3. **Deployment:**
   - Follow the deployment instructions in the `config/deployment_instructions.md`.

## Usage
Interact with the smart bin through the connected mobile or web application to monitor waste levels and receive notifications.
